# Polynomial-Regression
This notebook explores how to implement Polynomial Regression using Python and scikit-learn. It focuses on understanding how polynomial features help capture complex, non-linear relationships in data.

Whatâ€™s covered in the notebook:

Generating synthetic datasets to simulate real-world data.

Using PolynomialFeatures to create higher-degree terms.

Training and comparing models with varying polynomial degrees.

Visualizing how increasing complexity can lead to underfitting, optimal fitting, and overfitting.

Exploring the bias-variance trade-off through learning curves.

 Key Concepts Demonstrated:

Polynomial regression is a powerful technique to solve underfitting in linear models.

But higher complexity can lead to overfitting, reducing generalization.

Choosing the right polynomial degree is critical for model performance.
